# VBA Green Stocks Analysis for the years 2017 and 2018

## Overview of the Project 

This is an analysis of the ![VBA_Challenge](https://github.com/TamaraGR/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) file. In this analysis we are helping a client get information and compare the Total Volume and Yeary Return of various green energy companies' stocks in 2017 and 2018. We designed a VBA macro for applying it to different years (namely, in our analysis, we are using it for the years 2017 and 2018). The VBA macro calculates price change for the said year, change in the percentage of the price for that year and the total volume traded for the same year. For the client's convinienece we have designed buttons inside our AllStocksAnalysis sheet of the mentioned above document to perform general all stocks analysis and refactured all stocks analysis. With the help of this analysis our client can review which stocks have performed better than others.

2017 was a pretty good year for the green energy companies' stocks market. As we can see from the image above, all of the stocks had positive returns with the exception of the TERP stock, which had a negative return of -7.2%. DQ and SEDG had the highest returns with 199.4% and 184.5% respectively. 

2018 looks very different from 2017. As we can see from the image above, most stocks had a negative return, except ENPH at 81.9% and RUN at 84.0%. We must note that in 2017 these two stocks scored at 129.5% and 5.5% respectively. The stock that was the lowest in 2017, TERP, was recorded at a negative return of -5%, however, it's the one with least changes in compariosn to all the other stocks analyzed. At the same time, 2017's stocks with highest return rate, DQ and SEDG, scored at -62.6% and -7.8%. 

The analysis of the greenstocks returns for the years 2017 and 2018 doesn't give us enough data to provide our client with adequeate level of detail and forecast/ advice with regards to which stocks to purchase. The recommendation is to look beyond these two years for deeper analysis.
