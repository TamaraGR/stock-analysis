# VBA Green Stocks Analysis for the years 2017 and 2018

## Overview of the Project 

This is an analysis of the ![VBA_Challenge](https://github.com/TamaraGR/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) file. In this analysis we are helping a client get information and compare the Total Volume and Yeary Return of various green energy companies' stocks in 2017 and 2018. We designed a VBA macro for applying it to different years (namely, in our analysis, we are using it for the years 2017 and 2018). The VBA macro calculates price change for the said year, change in the percentage of the price for that year and the total volume traded for the same year. For the client's convinienece we have designed buttons inside our AllStocksAnalysis sheet of the mentioned above document to perform general all stocks analysis and refactured all stocks analysis. With the help of this analysis our client can review which stocks have performed better than others.
